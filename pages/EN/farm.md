intro: In our farm we make an effort to respect nature's rythms. We have a livestock
  of 80 goats, 2 billygoats and a dog. The well being of our animals is our number
  1 priority. From a healthy animal comes a first quality product. This is the reason
  why we make sure that they only eat natural fodder, that they spend as much time
  as possible outdoors and that even inside the stable they have a cosy space.

  description: Our attention to fodder is our first priority. From fodder depends
    the health of the animals and as a consequence of it the quality of the milk.
    Our goats eat what they choose from the fields, top quality selected hay and small
    quantities of organic cereals. In our stable we try as much as possible to mantain
    a healty balance and diet, looking to imitate what they would normally eat in
    wilderness.
  list:
  - name: Hay
    description: In winter, hay is the first source of nutrition for goats. The hay
      we use is a "second cut" made by a local farmer. Characteristic of second cut
      hay is its freshness, green color and strong herbal parfumes. Goats are extremely
      greedy for this kind of grass, as supposed to cows and horses that prefer the
      first cut, dryer and thicker.

  - name: Pastures
    description: In the good season our goats spend most of their days in the open
      fields. The fresh air, the sun and the fresh grass and herbs they find around
      have an extreme effect on their health. When goats are regularly in the fields
      their fur is visibly healthier, they are more relaxed and their milk is of a
      more delicate and higher quality. The fields where our goats roam around are
      left in their wild state, fertilized by the manure of the goats.

  - name: Cereals
    description: The cereals our goats eat are produced by a regional Bio Land farm.
      The mix we chose is made of oats, wheat, rye, corn and peas. Once harvested,
      the grains are smashed into flakes to make the digestion and assumption of nutritives
      easier for the animals.

  description: In cold seasons goats need a warm and dry place that protects and keeps
    them cozy in the wait for spring. Planning the inside of our stable we made sure
    to guarantee all animals an adequate livable space. The wooden fences delimit
    a space of adequate size for the number of goats hosted in it. Moreover, we build
    a various wooden structures allowing the animals to make some phisical excercise
    and to take repair from their more combative sisters. The abbundant use of straw
    ensures a comfortable, warm and dry bed.
- title: Human Contact

  description: The contained size of our livestock allows us to have a direct contact
    with all animals. Every day, twice a day, whilst milking, we have the chance to
    monitor the health state of each goat, taking care of their diverse needs and
    promptly intervening when needed.
