title: Our Cheese
image: "/assets/img/cheese-home-title.jpg"
intro: The art of cheesemaking is an infinite universe and there is always something
  new to learn. We take a lot of inspiration from the Italian cheesmaking tradition.
  In crafting our cheese we look for semplicity and authenticity that leave space
  to the excellence of the raw material we use. Our offer of dairy products varies
  from the freshest and delicate cream cheeses to longer seasoned cheeses with more
  intense and sharper flavours.
products:
- name: Yoghurt

  ingredients:
  - Goats Milk
  - Lactic Ferments
  description: Few know that, if made without additives, goats milk yoghurt is very
    liquid. Instead of trying to change this quality to make it more dense with additives,
    we accept and embrace its nature. Our yoghurt is perfect both to drink and to
    eat with fruits and müsli. The quality of our milk comes through in this candid
    product.
- name: Primosale

  - "/assets/img/products/gallery/primosale2.jpg"
  ingredients:
  - Goats Milk
  - Lactic Ferments
  - Veal Rennet
  - Sea Salt
  description: Primosale means literally "Once in the salt". It is a silky and fresh
    cheese, consumed very young, since the day after its production. It is ready to
    be eaten as in its natural state, but also sliced in a Caprese Salad, melted in
    a pan with some anchovies or backed with thyme.
- name: Seasoned Primosale

  - "/assets/img/products/gallery/primosale-seasoned4.jpg"
  ingredients:
  - Goats Milk
  - Lactic Ferments
  - Veal Rennet
  - Sea Salt
  description: When Primosale matures for two or three weeks, his character completely
    changes. The cheese dries up a little and gets more compact. The ferments work
    the proteins, transforming and freeing hidden notes of the milk. It presents itself
    with a soft texture and some acidulous notes in the aftertaste, tipical flavours
    of medium matured goats cheeses.
- name: Primosale to Grate

  ingredients:
  - Goats Milk
  - Lactic Ferments
  - Veal Rennet
  - Sea Salt
  description: 'Let the Seasoned Primosale get a little older and here it is: his
    more compact brother. The small forms (circa 150g) are left to dry up to let the
    more sharp and salty notes emerge. A great cheese to hull and enjoy on its own
    or to grate on top of soups and pasta.'

  ingredients:
  - Goats Milk
  - Lactic Ferments
  - Veal or Goat Rennet
  - Sea Salt
  description: Opening a 2-3 Kg form of cheese is one of the big emotions that this
    craft gives us. The value of handicrafts are the imperfections that give character
    to what one produces. The minimal changes that vary from form to form in our homemade
    production, get amplified in the two-three months of rest in the seasoning room.
    Every cut is a surprise. Some recipes take inspiration from the central-south
    Italy, imitating the crystalline texture of Pecorino. Some other forms remind
    more of "smelly" mountain cheeses such as the Val D'Aosta fontina. At our counter,
    you will always find us happy to let you taste the "form of the day", to share
    with you the thrill of constantly learning what handicrafts hide from us.
- name: Ricotta

  - "/assets/img/products/gallery/ricotta5.jpg"
  ingredients:
  - Milk Serum
  - Goats Milk
  - Citric Acid
  - Cows Cream
  - Sea Salt
  description: Soft, creamy and delicate. A poor product by the rich story. After
    cheese making, the milk serum (the liquid part of the milk) gets heated up to
    90° to let the flakes of Ricotta appear. In Italian, Ricotta acutally means "cooked
    again". In ancient pesant tradition it has always been important to use 100% of
    the raw materials. It is so that in Italy farmers would boil the serum and extract
    Ricotta before giving the rest of the liquid to the pigs. In our recipe we add
    some cows cream to give extra creaminess and some citric acid to enhance the process
    of coagulation.
- name: Ricotta Salata
  image: ''
  gallery: []
  ingredients:
  - Milk Serum
  - Goats Milk
  - Citric Acid
  - Cows Cream
  - Sea Salt
  description: When Ricotta is too much (and in our opinion it is never enough) the
    small forms are rolled in salt and left to dry to enhance its preservation. The
    result is a sister product of the fresh Ricotta, also very renouned to be used
    on soups and pasta dishes.
- name: Fresh Cream Cheese

  ingredients:
  - Goats Milk
  - Lactic Ferments
  - Veal Rennet
  - Sea Salt
  - Natural Herbs
  - Honey and Nuts (only in one of the varieties)
  description: 'A grand classic of goats milk derivates. Its creminess comes from
    a slow process that lasts at least 36 hours. Due to its working technique a small
    part of milk serum gets retained inside the cheese, giving it a velvety texture
    and a wide range of olfactory notes. We offer it in its natural essence or in
    some variations we came up with: chive and garlic, oregano, cashews and honey.'
