intro: |-
  We are a goats farm in Kümmern, on the hills of Mannebach. We put together natural farming and our heritage of Italian cheese-making.

  The result is a variety of cheese of which we are very fond and we hope one day you'll love them too.

  intro: |-
    In our farm we make an effort to respect the rythms of the earth. We have a livestock of 80 goats, 2 billygoats and a dog. The well being of our animals is our number 1 priority.

    From a healthy animal comes a first quality product. This is the reason why we make sure that they only eat natural fodder, they rest without being milked for about a month a year, that they spend as much time as possible outdoors and that even inside the stable they have a cosy space.

  intro: The art of cheesemaking is an infinite universe and there is always something
    new to learn. We take a lot of inspiration from the Italian cheesmaking tradition.
    In crafting our cheese we look for semplicity and authenticity that leave space
    to the excellence of the raw material we use. Our offer of dairy products varies
    from the freshest and delicate cream cheeses to older cheeses with sharper flavours.

  intro: 'The role of the community of Mannebach and Kūmmern has been and keeps beeing
    of fundamental importance for the success of our project. Through the years, there
    have been many people that helped us and with whom we have developed friendships.
    This is all that matters to us: when the local community recognises our effort
    and passion, we are satisfied. '
