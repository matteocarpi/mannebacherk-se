description: We love the contact with our customers. We believe closing the circle of food production and taking care of our product from the field to your table has an extreme value. Today that value is getting more and more lost in mass production and consumption of alimentary goods. That is why we take care of the distribution of our cheese. Across the week you will find us with our van in different markets around the region.
