intro: We love the contact with our customers. We believe closing the circle of food
  production and taking care of our product from the field to your table has an extreme
  value. Today that value is getting more and more lost in mass production and consumption
  of alimentary goods. That is why we take care of of our cheese from production to
  distribution., Across the week you will find us with our van in different markets
  around the region.
